# 🤝 Match Mentor

Empowering student-mentor collaboration through intelligent matchmaking and real-time communication.

Developed during Hacksprint v6.0 by Atharva Karval, Om Dalbhanjan, and Samarth Patil.

## 🌟 Overview

Match Mentor addresses the challenges engineering students face in finding suitable mentors and forming balanced teams for projects, competitions, and hackathons. By leveraging a microservices architecture and a MongoDB cluster, the platform offers intelligent matchmaking, real-time communication, and collaborative tools to foster an engaging ecosystem for students and mentors.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Engineering students across different years often struggle to find the right mentors or assemble well-balanced teams for projects, competitions, and hackathons. This leads to missed opportunities for learning, innovation, and peer collaboration.

Your challenge is to build a platform that allows students to:
- Showcase their skills
- Connect with mentors
- Intelligently form teams based on skill compatibility and project requirements

The system should also include incentive mechanisms—like badges, reputation scores, or leaderboards—to encourage mentorship and active participation. The goal is to create an engaging ecosystem that empowers students to collaborate and grow together.
